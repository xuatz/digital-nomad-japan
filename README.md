# Digital Nomad Resources (Japan)

My friend suggested to me that I should make a list about some of the nomad friendly resources I've come across.
It's barely any effort and it would delight me if this can help someone else, so I will be putting them up here.
I'm not sure how much longer will I will continue with the nomad life but who cares lol.

I may use this opportunity to make a simple website in svelte and have a table so I dont have to worry about if i should group items based on type (hotel/airbnb) or locations.

## Hotels

### Sendai

* [Henn na Hotel Sendai Kokubuncho](http://www.booking.com/Share-s7GrKh) - Standard Double Room
  * spacious room, big TV with chromecast and hdmi, in-room "dry cleaning" with LG Styler available, deep L shaped working desk with plenty of room for writing, multiple monitors and laptop space, with a decent working office chair, no in-room washing machine but it is available for 600yen on first floor

## Airbnb

### Sapporo

* [Apartment in Susukino](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/42364434)
  * spacious room. huge table good for work. not the best chair, could feel the feet of the chair poking into the seat cushion for some reason and the arm rest are at a weird position that hurts after awhile. washing machine provided with no dryer, but there is sufficient drying area and equipments.
